# Community Sidekicks

## Introduction

“Community Sidekicks” is a humanitarian website in which you can sign up to donate your time to a number of organizations in search of people willing to do volunteer work. Non-profit organizations can create an account and see a list of volunteers, and volunteers can sign up to be viewed and vetted by organizations.

## User Story

- As an organization, I want to be able to be taken to the create account page or login in page and view volunteers that have signed up
